    angle = int(elapsed/timer * 360)

    ## shape should be drawn to.

        points_s.append((x, y))
    points_s.append((cx, cy))

    ## ^^ ^^ Adds points around the outside of the "circle" that will
    ## be the pie shape. Because pygame doesn't have a filled_pie()
    ## function, I need to use a workaround like this.
    ## The points_s list contains an identical polygon, but 0.7 pixels smaller.

    pygame.gfxdraw.aacircle(screen, cx, cy, radius+3, DARKRED)
    pygame.gfxdraw.filled_circle(screen, cx, cy, radius+3, DARKRED)

        pygame.gfxdraw.aapolygon(screen, points, DARKRED)

    pygame.gfxdraw.aacircle(screen, cx, cy, radius, DARKRED)
    pygame.gfxdraw.aacircle(screen, cx, cy, (radius-1), DARKRED)

    ## ^^ those just draw the shapes that alias and hide rough edges of the
    ## un antialiasable shapes, like the polygon.

    ## So, for example of this whole function, the player has used up 12.4 seconds,
    ## and pressed 6 keys. Their total time will now be 33 seconds, because of the
    ## +0.5 seconds for each key.
    ## That means that the circle needs to fill (12.4/33*100 = 37.57)% of itself.
    ## For a circle, that means multiplying 0.3757 by 360. In this case, 135 degrees.
    ## Then, the for loop takes the list of the center points, and adds 135 points,
    ## plus the center point again to close the polygon.

    ## This drawing uses a trick: Instead of drawing a light circle and emptying it,
    ## since that would involve knowing every point on the circle and pulling all but
    ## the first and last out over time, it draws a light circle with a dark circle
    ## over top of it, and covers it up. That's why there are so many layers: to
    ## conceal the gap between the two.

    ## this life bar is pretty simple. I use center-x and center-y so it would be easier to
    ## put in the same place as the timer. The (w-(w*(mistakes/(strikes-1)))-1) thing is
    ## the width of the red bar: The full width, minus whatever fraction of it is used up.
    ## So, if they've made 2 out of their 5 mistakes (the strikes variable is 6 because
    ## it's the sixth that kills them, hence the -6), and the width is 480 pixels, then
    ## it will become (480 - (480*2/5)), or two fifths less than 480. The negative one on
    ## the w and h is just to make it fit nicer in the outer box.
