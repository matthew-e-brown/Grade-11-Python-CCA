# Grade 11 Python CCA -- KeyPress Game
This was the final project I made for my Grade 11 Python in ICS-2O1 at Bayside Secondary. Runs with Pygame.

I'm intentionally leaving this code the way it was when I handed it in (with the exception of fixing _fatal_ errors), so that it's representative of the work I did at the time.

That being said, the Revisions Branch holds some updated code in my quest to make it more Pythonic. I also intend to fully rewrite the program with a newfound understanding of object oriented programming.

## View the Remake!!
I've recently gone through with a better understanding of programming and remade this game. The new version's repository is [here](https://github.com/matthew-e-brown/Keypress-Remake).
